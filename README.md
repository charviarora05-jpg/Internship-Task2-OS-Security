# Internship Task 2: OS Security

## Overview
This task helped me learn the fundamentals of **Operating System (OS) Security** in both Linux and Windows environments. I practiced managing **user accounts**, **file permissions**, understanding **administrator vs standard user privileges**, enabling and configuring **firewalls**, monitoring **running processes**, and **disabling unnecessary services**. I also applied **OS hardening techniques** to enhance system security.

## Objectives / Learning Outcomes
- Understand and manage user accounts and access controls  
- Learn the difference between administrator and standard user privileges  
- Implement file permissions using Linux commands (`chmod`, `chown`, `ls -l`)  
- Configure firewalls (UFW on Linux, Windows Firewall)  
- Identify running processes and unnecessary services  
- Document and apply best OS hardening practices

## Tools Used
- **Primary:** Ubuntu Linux (Virtual Machine), Windows Defender  
- **Alternatives:** Kali Linux, Fedora  

## Implementation Steps
1. Installed Linux VM and set up Windows environment  
2. Created multiple users with different privilege levels  
3. Assigned and verified file permissions for files and directories  
4. Enabled and configured firewall rules to allow essential traffic only  
5. Identified running processes and disabled unnecessary services  
6. Documented all commands, steps, and best practices

## Screenshots / Examples
- Include screenshots of terminal commands, file permissions, firewall settings, and process monitoring here for reference.

## Conclusion / Key Learnings
This task enhanced my understanding of **OS-level security** and provided hands-on experience in practical **system hardening**. I learned how to secure both Linux and Windows environments by managing permissions, controlling access, and reducing potential vulnerabilities.
